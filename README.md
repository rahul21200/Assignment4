The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981 with further developments by Yoon in 1987, and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993. TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS).

Step 1. Construct the decision matrix and determine the weight of criteria.<br>
Step 2. Calculate the normalized decision matrix.<br>
Step 3. Calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix. <br>
Step 4. Determine the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions<br>
Step 5. Calculate the separation measures from the positive ideal solution
and the negative ideal solution. <br>
Step 6. Calculate the relative closeness to the positive ideal solution. <br>
Step 7. Rank the preference order.<br>
